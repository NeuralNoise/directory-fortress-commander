   <body>
       Commander is a web application that interface with <A HREF="http://www.jts.us/iamfortress/javadocs/api/index.html">Fortress</A> and <A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/">OpenLDAP</A>.

       <h2>What technologies are in use?</h2>

       Commander was built using established <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</A> technologies including
       <A HREF="http://wicket.apache.org//">Apache Wicket</A> (Web UI framework), <A HREF="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring Framework</A> (glue), <A HREF="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</A> (dependencies)
       and runs inside any reasonably compliant Java Servlets container.

       Access control decisions are enforced using <A HREF="http://www.jts.us/iamfortress/javadocs/api-sentry/index.html?overview-summary.html">Sentry</A> which itself
       uses declarative <A HREF="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbwk.html">Java EE Security</A> and <A HREF="http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/">Spring Security</A> policy hooks that are wired to
       connect back to the <A HREF="org/openldap/fortress/rbac/package-summary.html">Fortress</A> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">RBAC</A> component.

       Fine-grained access control decisions are enforced using <A HREF="http://www.jts.us/iamfortress/javadocs/api/org/openldap/fortress/DelAccessMgr.html">Fortress ARBAC delegated access management.</A>

       Commander server-side is a <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/tools/webapps_1/">Java Web program</a> artifact and is wholly dependent on <A HREF="http://www.jts.us/iamfortress/javadocs/api/index.html">Fortress</A>
       but also needs a <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">V3 compliant LDAP</A> server like OpenLDAP.  For more information on installing and setting up OpenLDAP check out
       <A HREF="http://www.jts.us/iamfortress/guides/README-QUICKSTART.html">Fortress Quickstart</A>

       <h2>What can Commander do?</h2>

       Contained within this application are Web pages to perform ANSI RBAC administration along with IETF password policies and viewing the security audit trail and history of changes.

      <h2>What are the conditions of use?</h2>
